# Plan what all things required and how all what are the things and best methods to implement it plan all each and every basic need and files what are technologies and the thu=ings in each and every sort look in detail and give me a report.

***RIVION: A Real-Time Multimodal Emotion-Aware Conversational Agent”**
> or
> **“RoboCompanion: Video-Call Based Emotion-Aware Mental Wellness Chatbot”**

In your report, highlight:

* **Novelty**: Multimodal (face + voice + text), not just one.
* **Use case**: Stress detection, burnout prevention, emotional support.
* **Tech depth**: Computer vision + audio ML + NLP + full-stack + deployment.
* **Industry value**: aligns with mental health apps, HR wellness tools, edtech focus, etc.

## 🧪 Practical Scope (What You Can Actually Build)

To keep it realistic for MCA:

**Minimum Viable Version (but still impressive):**

1. Video + text chat interface (no full audio-to-text initially).
2. Face + text emotion detection (add voice later if time).
3. Simple fusion logic + LLM adapter.
4. Streamlit or web dashboard for emotion charting.

Then if you have time, add:

* Voice emotion.
* More advanced fusion (attention-based).
* User accounts \& saved history.

Perfect! Let me create one final visual document:
